 Question 1: What causes the error "CrashLoopBackOff" in a Kubernetes pod, and how do you troubleshoot it?
:->
	Indicates that pod is starting and crashing and kubernetes restarting it again and again
	Resolution:
	Check the logs: kubectl logs podname
			kubectl describe pod podname
	Can be related to incorrect envirnment variables
	Failed dependancies
	missconfiguration in containers commands


🔹 Question 2: Why might a Kubernetes pod be stuck in the "Pending" state, and how do you resolve it?
A Kubernetes pod can be stuck in the “Pending” state due to several reasons:
	1.	Insufficient Resources: Not enough CPU/memory on nodes.
	•	Fix: Free up resources or adjust pod’s resource requests.
	2.	Node Affinity/Taints: Node constraints or taints preventing scheduling.
	•	Fix: Check and adjust node affinity, or add tolerations to the pod.
	3.	PVC Binding Issues: Persistent volume claim not bound to a persistent volume.
	•	Fix: Ensure PV is available and matches PVC requirements.
	4.	Image Pull Issues: Unable to pull the container image.
	•	Fix: Verify image name and registry credentials.
	5.	Quota Limitations: Resource quotas preventing new pods.
	•	Fix: Check and adjust resource quotas.
	6.	Scheduler Issues: No suitable node found for the pod.
	•	Fix: Check pod constraints and scheduler logs.
	7.	Pod Priority: Higher-priority pods occupying resources.
	•	Fix: Adjust pod priorities or scale down higher-priority pods.

To troubleshoot, use kubectl describe pod <pod-name> and check events for detailed information.
